OAuth Scopes for your app

Some Sandbox capabilities and OAuth scopes are only available with additional licenses or contracts in Production. Refer to the API Documentation for eligibility.

ecomstorwe has been granted these OAuth scopes.
By enabling OAuth, you agree that when your application redirects users to the eBay sign-in flow to get a token, it will include,via the sign-in URL parameters, the minimum required scopes defined for each eBay API your application uses, as well as any additional scopes that reasonably characterize the intent of your application, the actions it will perform as well as the types of data it will collect on behalf of the eBay member, and how that data will be used.
