How to Guide the Replit AI Agent to Build & Integrate the eBay Store Migration Tool

Follow this step-by-step approach while working with the Replit AI Agent:

⸻

1. Provide Clear Context to Replit AI

Start by explaining what you’re building and what the integration needs to do:

Example Prompt for Replit AI:

	“I am working on an application that needs to integrate an eBay store migration tool in Replit.
This tool should:
		•	Authenticate with the eBay API.
	•	Fetch active product listings.
	•	Save the data in a structured format (JSON/CSV).
	•	Provide a function to sync eBay data regularly.
I need you to generate modular, reusable code that fits into my existing application. Let’s break it down step by step.”

2. Set Up Environment & Dependencies

Tell Replit AI to install dependencies.

Prompt:

	“First, install the required libraries. Since we’re using Python, add:	Create a .env file for storing API credentials.”

Additional Command:

	“Create a .env file in the root directory with:	Ensure the app loads these credentials securely.”

⸻

3. Authenticate with eBay API (OAuth 2.0)

Now, instruct Replit AI to create a script for authentication.

Prompt:

	“Write a script get_token.py to fetch an OAuth token from eBay. It should:
		•	Read CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET from .env.
	•	Use Base64 encoding for authentication.
	•	Request a token using requests.
	•	Print the access_token on success.
	•	Handle errors gracefully.”

⸻

4. Fetch eBay Product Listings

Now, guide Replit AI to fetch products.

Prompt:

	“Create a script fetch_products.py to retrieve active product listings from eBay. It should:
		•	Use the access_token from get_token.py.
	•	Fetch inventory items from eBay.
	•	Return product data as JSON.
	•	Save the output to ebay_products.json.”

⸻

5. Store & Export Data

Tell Replit AI to store data in a CSV format.

Prompt:

	“Modify fetch_products.py to:
		•	Save product data as ebay_products.json.
	•	Also export the data to ebay_products.csv with columns: Product ID, Title, Price, Quantity.”

⸻

6. Automate Product Sync

Now, automate the tool to keep eBay data updated.

Prompt:

	“Create a script sync_ebay.py that:
		•	Runs fetch_products.py on a schedule.
	•	Uses cron to sync daily.
	•	Logs updates to sync_log.txt.”

⸻

7. Integrate with Existing Application

Now that the tool is built, integrate it into your app.

Prompt:

	“Modify our existing application to:
		•	Call fetch_products.py when loading eBay products.
	•	Display eBay products inside our app UI.
	•	Provide a button to refresh/sync product data.”

⸻

8. Deploy & Test in Replit

Finally, deploy and test everything.

Prompt:

	“Set up Replit’s Always On feature or a crontab to automate product sync.
Test by running:	Verify that ebay_products.json and ebay_products.csv update correctly.”
