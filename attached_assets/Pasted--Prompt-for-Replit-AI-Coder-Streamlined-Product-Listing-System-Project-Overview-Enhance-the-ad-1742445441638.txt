```

#### Data Validation & Preview
```
Create comprehensive validation system:

1. Pre-Import Validation

   - Required field verification
   - Duplicate SKU detection
   - Pricing consistency checks

2. Interactive Preview Grid
   - Spreadsheet-like view of all products
   - Inline editing capabilities
   - Filtering options to focus on problems
   - Column visibility toggles
```

#### Post-Import Tools
```
Create post-processing options:

1. Batch Actions

   - Category assignment
   - Tag application
   - Featured product marking

2. Confirmation System
   - Success/error summary report
   - Downloadable import log

```

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. Frontend Requirements
   - Use React components consistent with existing application
   - Implement form state management with proper validation
   - Ensure all UI elements follow accessibility guidelines
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

2. Backend Considerations
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for all product operations
   - Implement proper error handling and feedback
   - Ensure database transactions for data integrity
   - Add caching where appropriate for performance

3. Image Processing
   - Implement server-side image optimization
   - Create secure temporary storage for bulk uploads
   - Handle various image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

4. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading for image-heavy sections
   - Pagination for bulk product lists
   - Asynchronous validation to prevent UI blocking

## Testing Requirements
1. Verify the solution works with various product types and categories
2. Test bulk import with both valid and invalid data
3. Ensure mobile/tablet compatibility for all interfaces
4. Validate with actual admin users if possible

## Deliverables
1. Frontend components matching application's design system
2. API endpoints documentation
3. Database schema updates if needed
4. User guide explaining the new workflow
